# TypeScript Bundling Template

This repository is a **template project** for setting up a reusable development environment using **TypeScript**, **esbuild**, and **nodemon**. It's designed to be a starting point for quickly creating TypeScript projects with fast bundling, automatic rebuilds, and automatic execution.

---

## Features

- **TypeScript**: A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that helps improve code quality and maintainability.
- **esbuild**: A highly performant bundler and minifier for TypeScript and JavaScript.
- **nodemon**: A tool that automatically restarts the application whenever changes are detected in the source code.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 22.11.0)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 10.9.0)

---

## Getting Started

This template is designed for easy reuse in different projects. Here's how to get started with your own project using this template.

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs **TypeScript**, **esbuild**, and **nodemon** as development dependencies.

### 3. Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source TypeScript files (the entry point is `src/index.ts`).
- **`dist/`**: Contains the generated bundled JavaScript files after running the build process.
- **`build.ts`**: A build script written in TypeScript that uses **esbuild** to bundle the application.
- **`nodemon.json`**: Configuration for **nodemon** to monitor file changes and restart the application.

### 4. Run the Development Environment

To start the development environment and enable file watching, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- **`nodemon`** will watch for changes in the `src/` directory, trigger the build process when files are modified, and automatically run the output in `dist/bundle.js`.
- You don't need to manually rebuild or run the application â€“ it happens automatically as you make changes.

### 5. File Watching and Execution

- **`ts-node build.ts`**: This command will run the TypeScript build script that bundles your TypeScript files using **esbuild**.
- **`node dist/bundle.js`**: This will execute the bundled JavaScript file generated by **esbuild**.

### 6. Customize `nodemon.json`

You can adjust the `nodemon.json` configuration file to customize the files being watched, extensions, or the command being executed. Example:

```json
{
  "watch": ["src"],
  "ext": "ts",
  "exec": "ts-node build.ts && node dist/bundle.js"
}
```

---

## Commands

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development environment with **nodemon**. It watches for changes in the `src/` folder, rebuilds the project with **esbuild**, and runs the output automatically.

---

## How It Works

1. **esbuild** bundles and minifies the TypeScript code from `src/index.ts` and outputs it to the `dist/bundle.js` file.
2. **nodemon** monitors the `src/` directory for any changes. Whenever a change is detected, it triggers the build process and runs the generated output file automatically.
3. This setup ensures that your development process is streamlined and efficient, with automatic rebuilding and execution as you modify your code.

---

## Example Output

When you run `npm run dev`, you should see the following in your terminal:

```
[esbuild] Build completed successfully.
[nodemon] starting `node dist/bundle.js`
Hello, esbuild and nodemon!
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
```
